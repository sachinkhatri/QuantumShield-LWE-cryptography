# Project Roadmap for QuantumShield-LWE-Cryptography

---

## ðŸš€ Current Status (v0.1)

- Proof-of-concept implementation of Multi-Block LWE encryption scheme.  
- Integration with Hamming (7,4) error correction code.  
- Basic key generation, encryption, decryption functions.  
- Initial unit tests and example scripts.  
- Documentation skeleton (README, docs folder with initial files).

---

## ðŸ”œ Short-Term Goals (v0.2 - v0.3)

- [ ] Improve error correction by integrating stronger codes (e.g., BCH, Reed-Solomon).  
- [ ] Parameter tuning for noise, key sizes, and block sizes to reduce decryption errors.  
- [ ] Enhance test coverage with edge cases and performance benchmarks.  
- [ ] Add detailed mathematical background and algorithm explanation in docs.  
- [ ] Develop CONTRIBUTING.md and issue/PR templates.  
- [ ] Automate tests and coverage reporting with CI (e.g., GitHub Actions).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mid-Term Goals (v0.4 - v1.0)

- [ ] Implement advanced noise management techniques for better reliability.  
- [ ] Optimize encryption and decryption speed and memory usage.  
- [ ] Formal security analysis and potential peer review.  
- [ ] Create more comprehensive example applications and interactive demos (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks).  
- [ ] Package as an installable Python package and publish to PyPI.  
- [ ] Expand documentation with tutorials and usage guides.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Long-Term Vision (v1.x and beyond)

- [ ] Integrate lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic primitives beyond basic LWE.  
- [ ] Develop a complete, production-ready cryptosystem with formal verification.  
- [ ] Explore integration with blockchain or decentralized systems.  
- [ ] Build a community around the project with regular updates, support, and collaboration.  
- [ ] Potential research publications and academic collaboration.
